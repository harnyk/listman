# Listman

An AI-powered Telegram bot allowing to manage lists.

## How it works

Once the bot is Deployed to Vercel, you can use it to create and manage shopping lists.

Just send a message to the bot and it will do the rest.

Listman uses OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini model to translate messages written in natural language into lists.

For voice messages OpenAI's Whisper model is used.

As a result Listman will create a list and provide you with a link to manage it in the browser.

The list management web application is designed to work offline.
